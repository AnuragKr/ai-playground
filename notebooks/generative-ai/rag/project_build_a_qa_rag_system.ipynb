It is also known as Sweet Basil or Tulsi. It is a tender low-growing herb that is grown as a perennial in warm, tropical climates. Basil is originally native to India and other tropical regions of Asia. It has been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years. It is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world. Some of them are Italian, Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisines. It grows to between 30–60\\xa0cm tall. It has light green, silky leaves 3–5\\xa0cm long and 1–3\\xa0cm broad. The leaves are opposite each other. The flowers are quite big. They are white in color and arranged as a spike. The plant tastes somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent, sweet smell. Basil is very sensitive to cold. It is best grown in hot, dry conditions. While most common varieties are treated as annuals, some are perennial, including African Blue and Holy Thai basil. The word \"basil\" comes from the Greek βασιλεύς (\"basileus\"), meaning \"royal\". This is because it is believed to have grown above the spot where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" quotes speculations that basil may have been used in \"some royal unguent, bath, or medicine\". Basil is still considered the \"king of herbs\" by many cookery authors. An alternative etymology has \"basil\" coming from the Latin word \"basilicus\", meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk, but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece.')]"

It is the second largest city in India after Mumbai. It is on the east bank of the River Hooghly. When it is called Calcutta, it includes the suburbs. This makes it the third largest city of India. This also makes it the world's 8th largest metropolitan area as defined by the United Nations. Kolkata served as the capital of India during the British Raj until 1911. Kolkata was once the center of industry and education. However, it has witnessed political violence and economic problems since 1954. Since 2000, Kolkata has grown due to economic growth. Like other metropolitan cities in India, Kolkata struggles with poverty, pollution and traffic congestion. The discovery of the nearby Chandraketugarh, an archaeological site has proved that people have lived there for over two millennia. The history of Kolkata begins when the English East India Company arrived in 1690. Job Charnock, an administrator with the Company is traditionally known as the founder of this city. However some academics say that Charnock is not the city's founder. At that time Kolkata, ruled by the Nawab of Bengal Siraj-Ud-Daulah, had three villages. They were Kalikata, Govindapur and Sutanuti. The British in the late 17th century wanted to build a fort near Govindapur. This was to become more powerful than Dutch, the Portuguese, and the French. In 1702, the British completed the construction of old Fort William, which was used to station its troops and as a regional base. Calcutta was declared a Presidency City, and later became the headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. When regular fights with French forces started, in 1756 the British began to upgrade their fortifications. When this was protested, the Nawab of Bengal Siraj-Ud-Daulah attacked and captured Fort William. This led to the infamous Black Hole incident.

However, the capital shifted to the hilly town of Shimla during the summer months every year, starting from the year 1864. Richard Wellesley, the Governor General between 1797–1805, helped in the growth of the city and its public architecture. This led to the description of Calcutta as \"The City of Palaces\".

              "1. **Phonology**: This is the study of sounds in language. It looks at how sounds are organized and used in different languages.\n",
              "\n",
              "2. **Morphology**: This area focuses on the structure of words, including parts of words like prefixes (e.g., \"un-\") and suffixes (e.g., \"-ing\").\n",
              "\n",
              "3. **Syntax**: Syntax deals with how words are arranged to form sentences. It examines the rules that govern sentence structure.\n",
              "\n",
              "4. **Semantics**: This part studies the meaning of words and how they combine to create meaning in sentences.\n",
              "\n",
              "5. **Pragmatics**: Pragmatics looks at the unspoken aspects of communication, such as how context influences the interpretation of what is said. For example, if someone says \"I'm cold,\" they might be hinting that they want someone to turn off a fan.\n",
              "\n",
              "Linguistics can be divided into two main branches: theoretical linguistics and applied linguistics. Theoretical linguists explore the underlying principles of language, including how languages have evolved over time (historical linguistics) and how different social groups use language (sociolinguistics). On the other hand, applied linguists use linguistic knowledge in practical ways, such as in forensic linguistics for crime investigations or computational linguistics to help computers understand human language, like in speech recognition systems.\n",
              "\n",
              "In summary, linguistics is a broad field that examines all aspects of language, from sounds and word structures to meanings and social usage."
