Blue whales can reach lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) or more and can weigh as much as 200 tons (approximately 181 metric tonnes) or more. These magnificent marine mammals are not only the largest animals alive today but are also believed to be the largest animals to have ever existed on Earth. Their size is truly remarkable, with hearts that can weigh as much as a small car and tongues that can weigh as much as an elephant!"
