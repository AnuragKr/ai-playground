              "AIMessage(content=\"A mortgage is a type of loan specifically used to purchase real estate, such as a home or property. In a mortgage agreement, the borrower (the person buying the property) receives funds from a lender (usually a bank or financial institution) to buy the property. In return, the borrower agrees to repay the loan amount, plus interest, over a specified period, typically 15 to 30 years.\\n\\nKey features of a mortgage include:\\n\\n1. **Collateral**: The property itself serves as collateral for the loan. If the borrower fails to make the required payments, the lender has the right to take possession of the property through a legal process called foreclosure.\\n\\n2. **Down Payment**: Most mortgages require a down payment, which is a percentage of the property's purchase price that the borrower pays upfront. The remaining amount is financed through the mortgage.\\n\\n3. **Interest Rate**: Mortgages come with either fixed or variable interest rates.

            "A mortgage is a type of loan specifically used to purchase real estate, where the property itself serves as collateral for the loan. When a borrower takes out a mortgage, they agree to repay the loan amount, plus interest, over a specified period, typically 15 to 30 years. Mortgages are commonly used by individuals and families to buy homes, but they can also be used for investment properties or commercial real estate.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Principal**: The original loan amount borrowed from the lender.\n",
            "2. **Interest**: The cost of borrowing the principal, expressed as a percentage. This can be fixed (stays the same throughout the loan term) or variable (can change at specified times).\n",
            "3. **Term**: The length of time over which the loan must be repaid, commonly 15, 20, or 30 years.\n",
            "4. **Down Payment**: The initial amount paid upfront by the borrower, usually expressed as a percentage of the property’s purchase price. A larger down payment can reduce the loan amount and may eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance (PMI).\n",
            "5. **Amortization**: The process of gradually paying off the loan through regular payments, which cover both principal and interest.\n",
            "6. **Escrow**: An account where funds are held for property taxes and insurance, which are often included in monthly mortgage payments.\n",

            "3. **Interest-Only Mortgage**: The borrower pays only the interest for a certain period, after which they begin paying both principal and interest.\n",

            "3. **Tax Benefits**: Mortgage interest payments may be tax-deductible, depending on local laws and regulations.\n",
            "4. **Fixed Payments**: With a fixed-rate mortgage, monthly payments remain stable, making budgeting easier.\n",
